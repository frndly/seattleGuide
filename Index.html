        <p id="one">Seattle (AKA Emerald City), the largest city in Washington state, is located on Puget Sound
        about 100 miles south of the Canadian border. Its name comes from Chief Sealth of the
        Duwamish tribes. Although it had been inhabited by Native Americans for 4,000 years, Seattle
        became a city in 1869. In its early days it was known first as a timber town and later as the main
        supply point for men seeking gold in Alaska and the Yukon.
        In 1962, Seattle hosted the World’s Fair and debuted the famous landmark The Space Needle.
        Seattle was also the birthplace of aviation great, The Boeing Company. Today it is home to
        technology companies such as Amazon and Nintendo and coffee giant Starbucks (“History of Seattle,” n.d.).</p>
