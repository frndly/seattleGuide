                            Jet City Improv was founded in 1992, "To educate, enlighten, and entertain audiences through the art of improvisation" (Jet City Improv, n.d., para. 2). Jet City Improv has their very own flagship show, where you, the audience member, dictate what the cast members must do. They also perform improv, making fun of traditionally scary movies, all with the help of the audience who dictates what they want the cast to do next (Jet City Improv, n.d.).

                            Jet City Improv is open every weekend for your comedy needs. They are sometimes open during the week depending on show schedule. I highly recommend checking out their website <a href="http://www.jetcityimprov.org/"> Jet City Improv  </a> for an up to date show schedule and prices for each show.
