        <h1>Best Places To Eat In Seattle</h1>
        <h2>Whether you’re in the mood for authentic Mexican food, fresh sushi, dessert, or a fine dining experience atop the Seattle Space Needle, Seattle has it all and much more. Here are the top three restaurants that are a must visit on your trip to beautiful Seattle.</h2>
        <h3>Sky City</h3>
        <img  src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8279/29677459703_71d1793220_b.jpg' alt='A picture of the Seattle Space Needle by Ian D. Keating, on Flickr'/>
        <p>Talk about a beautiful view, “Located at 500 feet, SkyCity is the world’s oldest revolving restaurant” (Space Needle, n.d., para. 1). Your visit to the SkyCity restaurant is sure to impress, not just by the view, but by their extensive menu loaded with too many options to choose from. The menu has dishes like wild salmon, steaks, and for dessert you can try their “famous Lunar Orbiter dessert served since the World’s Fair opened in 1962” (Space Needle, n.d., para. 1).  Don’t forget to top your meal with a selection of Washington and Oregon wines, that are sure to satisfy your taste buds (Space Needle, n.d.). </p>
        <h4> Sadly, SkyCity Restaurant is closed for renovations at this time. But check out this website <a href="http://seewhatsup.space/" target="_blank">Seewhatsup </a>  for more information on the renovation project.  </h4>
        <h3>Fonda La Catrina</h3>

        <p>Are you a fan of authentic Mexican food that tastes like you are in Mexico and not Seattle? Fonda La Catrina offers all the classic Mexican food items like enchiladas, burritos and tortas. Or if you are feeling a little daring and want to break away from the norm, “fiery camarones sautéed in a crimson chile de árbol sauce” (Garbes, 2017, para. 4). No matter what you choose to dine on, you will be able to taste the tradition that goes into making each meal (Fonda La Catrina, n.d.).</p>
